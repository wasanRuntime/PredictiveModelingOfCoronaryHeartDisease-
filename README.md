# Cardiovascular Study Dataset: Predictive Modeling of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the **Cardiovascular Study Dataset** and build a logistic regression model to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). You will practice predictive modeling, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess the data, and evaluate the model performance.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Load and Inspect the Data**
### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handle Missing Data: Check for any missing values and decide how to address them (e.g., imputation or removal).
- Outlier Detection: Identify and address outliers in numerical columns.
- Feature Encoding: For categorical variables, encode them appropriately for the model (e.g., one-hot encoding).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize Data: Use plots (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to understand the distribution of variables and relationships with the target variable.
- Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between features and the target variable (CHD risk).

### 4. Feature Selection
- Select the most relevant features for the logistic regression model.
- Justify your choices based on EDA and domain knowledge.
- Perform transformations on features if necessary (e.g., log transformations for skewed distributions).

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
- Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training, 20% for testing).
- Logistic Regression: Train a logistic regression model on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Choose appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC) and evaluate the model.
- Threshold Optimization: Calculate the optimal threshold for classification using techniques like ROC curve analysis.

 ### 6. Model Interpretation
- Interpret the model's coefficients and the most predictive variables.
- Discuss how well the model performs based on accuracy and other metrics.

###  7. Reporting
Provide a clear and concise explanation of the model's performance metrics and coefficients.
Present insights derived from the analysis, including any patterns in the data or key predictors of CHD risk.

### Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with detailed steps, code, and visualizations.
